<p>The ancient Egyptians began numbering their years when the star Sirius rose at the same place as the SunThe Egyptian calendar was the first solar calendar and contained 365 days. These were divided into 12 30-day months and five days of festival (Neugebauer 1969). From astronomical calculations, Sirius and the Sun coincided in 4241 and 2773 BC, so either of these could have served as Egyptian Year 1.</p>
<p>The calendar used by the ancient Greeks was based on the Moon, and is known as the Metonic calendar. This calendar was based on the observations of Meton Eric Weisstein's World of Biography of Athens (ca. 440 BC), which showed that 235 lunar months made up almost exactly 19 solar years. This 19-year cycle became known as the Metonic cycle. However, given a nominal twelve-month year, an additional lunar months needed to be added to synchronize the cycle. These were added in years 3, 5, 8, 11, 13, 16, and 19 of the cycle. Around 325 BC, Callippus Eric Weisstein's World of Biography modified the calendar by noting that 4 19-year Metonic cycles with 940 months were very close to 27,759 days. This is called the Callipic cycle. Hipparchus Eric Weisstein's World of Biography noted that an even more accurate cycle (now called the Hipparchic cycle) consisted of four Callipic cycles less a day, in which days were very nearly 3760 months. However, neither system was widely used. A lunar-based calendar is still used bysome religious sects to determine holidays. Easter, for instance, generally occurs on the first Sunday following the first full moon after the vernal equinox, although the actual scheme is a bit more complicated still (Montes)Prior to 46 BC, the Roman calendar, or what has been reconstructed of it, is described as a "mess." </p>
<p>The Romans calendar originally started the year with the vernal equinox and consisted of 10 months (Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Junius, Quntilis, Sextilis, September, October, November, and December) having a total of 304 days. The numbers still embedded in the last four months of the year are the fossil of this (September, October, November, and December, contain the Latin roots for the numerals seven, eight, nine, and ten, but now fall on the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth months of the year). The 304 days were followed by an unnamed, unnumbered period in winter. The Roman emperor Numa Pompilius (715-673 BC) introduced February and January between January and March, increasing the length of the year to 354 or 355 days. Then in 450 BC, February was moved to its current position. In the year 46 BC, the Greek Sosigenes Eric Weisstein's World of Biography convinced Julius Caesar to reform the calendar to a more manageable form. The Julian calendar consisted of cycles of three 365-day years followed by a 366-day leap year. [sourse: http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/Calendar.html] </p>
